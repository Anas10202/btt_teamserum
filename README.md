## Project Overview

**Describe the Kaggle competition and its connection to the Break Through Tech AI Program**  

**Describe the objective of the challenge**  
The objective of the challenge is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify 21 different skin conditions from images, while making sure that the model performs equitably across different skin tones. In addition to trying to achieve a strong overall accuracy, the challenge is focused on creating a model that is fair and mindful of performance across different skin tones, especially for groups that have been underrepresented in healthcare AI.

**Explain the real-world significance of the problem and the potential impact of your work**  
In the real world, dermatology AI systems often underperform for individuals with darker skin tones due to biased or incomplete training data. This contributes to misdiagnoses, delayed treatment, and unfair outcomes for marginalized communities. By creating a more equitable AI model, our goal was to reduce these differences and improve healthcare access and quality for everyone. It also shows the importance of inclusivity in AI.



## Data Exploration

**Describe the dataset(s) used (i.e., the data provided in Kaggle + any additional sources)**  
**Describe your data exploration and preprocessing approaches**  
**Include at least 2â€“3 visualizations from your Exploratory Data Analysis**
